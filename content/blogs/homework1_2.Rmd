# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. 
```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```


Data Summary

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

glimpse(drinks)
skim(drinks)
```


Top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}

drinks %>% slice_max(order_by = beer_servings, n=25)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beer_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, beer_servings)))+geom_col(fill = "red") +
  theme_bw()+labs(
    title = "top 25 beer consuming countries",
    subtitle = "beer_servings",
    x = "beer_servings",
    y = "country"
  )+
  NULL

```

Top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

drinks %>% slice_max(order_by = wine_servings, n=25)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wine_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, wine_servings)))+geom_col(fill = "blue") +
  theme_bw()+labs(
    title = "top 25 wine consuming countries",
    subtitle = "wine_servings",
    x = "wine_servings",
    y = "country"
  )+
  NULL

```

Top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

drinks %>% slice_max(order_by = spirit_servings, n=25)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = spirit_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, spirit_servings)))+geom_col(fill = "green") +
  theme_bw()+labs(
    title = "top 25 spirit consuming countries",
    subtitle = "spirit_servings",
    x = "spirit_servings",
    y = "country"
  )+
  NULL

```


> The dispersion in beer servings among countries is not as high as the one for wine or spirit-servings where highest consuming country is twice as higher as the lowest consuming country in the list. Beer consuming countries and wine countries share some overlaps. The top 25 spirit consuming countries are completely different from the previous two groups.

> It is expected that beer and wine consumption are high in European countries as it can be cheaper and easier to buy in its origins. Spirits are consumed more in countries where there are social conventions or traditional occasions that require large consumption of spirits or countries that are located close to polar regions.

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("ca09.mfa2022","data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?
```{r}
skim(movies)
anyDuplicated(movies)
```
> No missing values or duplicates.

- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order

```{r}

movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise (count = n()) %>%  
  arrange(desc(count)) 

```

- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order
```{r}

movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarize(avg_gross = mean(gross),
            avg_budget=mean(gross/budget),
            return_on_budget=avg_gross/avg_budget) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_gross))

```

- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.
```{r}
movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>%  
  summarize(total_gross = sum(gross),
            avg_gross=mean(gross),max_gross=max(gross),
            med_gross = median(gross), 
            sd_gross = sd(gross)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_gross)) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = total_gross, n=15) 


```
- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. 
```{r}
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarize(
            avg_rating=mean(rating),
            med_rating = median(rating),
            max_rating=max(rating),
            min_rating = min(rating), 
            sd_rating = sd(rating)) 

ggplot(data=movies, aes(x=rating, group=genre, fill=genre)) +
    geom_density(adjust=1.5, alpha=.4) +
    facet_wrap(~genre) +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      axis.ticks.x=element_blank()
    )
```
> Ratings vary more for Documentary, Family, Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Western movie genres, and ratings seem to be similar for Romance, Musical, Mystery and Biography movie genres. 


## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. 
  
```{r, gross_on_fblikes}

ggplot(movies, aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, 
                        y=gross)) +
    geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(
  method=lm  
  )+
labs(
        x = "facebook likes",
        y = "gross",
        color = "Gear",
        title = "Relationship between facebook likes and gross earnings"
    )

summary(lm(gross ~ cast_facebook_likes, data=movies))

```
> The trend line suggests positive relationship between facebook likes and gross earnings of a movie. Hence facebook likes of the cast can be good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. 

```{r, gross_on_budget}

ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, 
                        y=gross)) +
geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(
  method=lm  
  )+
labs(
        x = "budget",
        y = "gross",
        color = "Gear",
        title = "Relationship between budget and gross earnings",
    )

summary(lm(gross ~ budget, data=movies))
```
> This plot shows the relationship between gross and budget much better than the previous one with facebook likes. Also the p-values let one assume a high significance in the positive relationship.
  
  
  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. 

```{r, gross_on_rating}

ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating, y = gross)) +
    geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ genre) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm) +
      labs(
        x = "rating",
        y = "gross",
        color = "Gear",
        title = "gross_on_rating",
    )

```
> There is generally a positive relationship between gross and rating for most movie genres as one would assume except for documentaries and Sci-Fi, which seem to have a worse rating for higher gross movies. But, it is also worth noting that for some genres, such as Musical, Family, Romance, Thriller and Western, there is not enough data as to come with a conclusion.



# Returns of financial stocks


> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

(Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.)


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyquant)
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("ca09.mfa2022","data","nyse.csv"))

```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order.

```{r companies_per_sector}

# table
nyse %>% 
  group_by(sector) %>% 
   count(sort=TRUE) 

# bar plot
nyse %>%
  mutate(sector = fct_rev(fct_infreq(sector)))%>%
  ggplot(aes(y=sector))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(
    title = "Number of companies per sector",
    subtitle = "Based on 508 stocks listed on the NYSE",
    x = "Count",
    y="Sector"
    )

```


Next, let's choose the [Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the 30 stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add `SPY` which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). 

```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

djia_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"


#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF

```

Now let us downlaod prices for all 30 DJIA consituents and the SPY ETF that tracks SP500 since January 1, 2020


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2000-01-01",
         to   = Sys.Date()) %>% # Sys.Date() returns today's price
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Produce a table that summarizes monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}


# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

p1 = myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarize(min=min(monthly_returns),
         max = max(monthly_returns),
         median = median(monthly_returns),
         mean = mean(monthly_returns),
         sd = sd(monthly_returns))
p1

```


Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = monthly_returns, color = symbol))+ 
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(symbol))+
  labs(
    title = "Monthly Returns",
    subtitle = "Based on 30 DJIA consituents and SPY ETF",
    x = "Monthly Return",
    y="Company Ticker")


```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky? 

> Riskiness can be interpreted as the variance of stock returns. The density plots suggests that Apple is the riskiest stock as the dispersion of its monthly returns seems to be the largest. SPY index and Microsoft or the S&P 500 seem to be the least risky one as most data concentrate around the mean with very little variance.


Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
ggplot(p1, aes(x=sd, y=mean, label=symbol))+
  geom_point()+
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel()+
  labs(
    title = "Expected monthly return vs risk",
    x = "Risk",
    y="Expected return")+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

> There is generally a positive relationship between risk and expected return. There are some that are riskier for the return that they generate. Examples would be INTC and CSCO.



# Is inflation transitory?


> You may find useful the material on [downloading economic data from the FRED](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/#data-from-the-federal-reserve-economic-data-with-tidyquant). 

A recent study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claimed that the [Current Inflation Spike Is Just Transitory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/current-inflation-spike-is-just-transitory-new-bis-study-argues). As the article says, 


> The surge in inflation seen across major economies is probably short lived because it’s confined to just a few sectors of the economy, according to the Bank for International Settlements. 

> New research by the BIS’s Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Egon Zakrajsek and Dora Xia adds to one of the hottest debates in economics -- how long the current surge in consumer prices will last. Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his euro-area counterpart Christine Lagarde have said the pickup is probably transitory, despite a snarled global supply chain and a spike in energy prices. 

You have to download data for CPI and the 10 year bill and produce the following graph


```{r cpi_10year, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("ca09.mfa2022","images", "cpi_10year.png"), error = FALSE)

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the  article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("ca09.mfa2022","images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```

Steps:

1. To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh) 
1. You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
1. Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)
 


```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data

  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))

# Just get the results for Trump
trump <- election2020_results %>% 
  filter(candidate == "DONALD J TRUMP") %>% 
  mutate(percentage = candidatevotes / totalvotes * 100)

# Have a leaner, simpler vaccine table

You may find counties that as of September 2021 have 0% vaccination; don't discard them immediately, try to find out why you have zeros!

> We researched the counties with 0% vaccination and think that the information is missing for them. Hence we discard them. 

> We realised that all counties with less than 5% of votes for M.Trump were filtered out in the original graph. A reason could be that such extreme results are likely to happen in areas with very few inhabitants, leading to statistically insignificant numbers for vaccination as well. Hence, we removed these data points as well.

> The author of the article did some more manipulation with the data however unexplained in its article, as the data in lower left triangle on our graph were intentionally left out on the original graph (vaccination rates could only be higher as time went by).

# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor).
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian. 


The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.


```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# similar graphs and analyses can be found at 
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
