# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. 
```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```

Top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}

drinks %>% slice_max(order_by = beer_servings, n=25)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beer_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, beer_servings)))+geom_col(fill = "red") +
  theme_bw()+labs(
    title = "top 25 beer consuming countries",
    subtitle = "beer_servings",
    x = "beer_servings",
    y = "country"
  )+
  NULL

```

Top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

drinks %>% slice_max(order_by = wine_servings, n=25)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wine_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, wine_servings)))+geom_col(fill = "blue") +

    subtitle = "wine_servings",
    x = "wine_servings",
    y = "country"
  )+
  NULL

```

Top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

drinks %>% slice_max(order_by = spirit_servings, n=25)%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = spirit_servings, y = fct_reorder(country, spirit_servings)))+geom_col(fill = "green") +
  theme_bw()+labs(
    title = "top 25 spirit consuming countries",
    subtitle = "spirit_servings",
    x = "spirit_servings",
    y = "country"
  )+
  NULL

```


> The dispersion in beer servings among countries is not as high as the one for wine or spirit-servings where highest consuming country is twice as higher as the lowest consuming country in the list. Beer consuming countries and wine countries share some overlaps. The top 25 spirit consuming countries are completely different from the previous two groups.

> It is expected that beer and wine consumption are high in European countries as it can be cheaper and easier to buy in its origins. Spirits are consumed more in countries where there are social conventions or traditional occasions that require large consumption of spirits or countries that are located close to polar regions.
